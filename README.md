# Ms. Pac-Man NES Tengen Disassembly
This is a disassembly of Duck Hunt for the NES. You know, that classic Zapper game with an annoying dog with it?

Doesn't include graphics data. You must rip the graphics yourself from the ROM.

Assemble the game using "ASM6N" - a fork of ASM6 (https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=18324).
